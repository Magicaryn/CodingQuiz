Coding Quiz!

This is a little quiz made to test you on some basic javascript knowledge. This utilizes several javascript functions to create a smooth transition between questions. This 75 second quiz has 5 multiple choice questions. dont think its too easy as if you get one wrong you get penalized 10 seconds. after you finish the quiz you get a chance to enter your initials to be put on the highscores board. and if you dont like someone on the highscore list with you, just clear scores and refresh to get them off the list!!
This quiz was challenging to me as it had a lot more depth that the last couple applications that i made. javascript can be extremely tricky and i found that i had started extremely confident then realized it was a lot more than i had anticipated. but it all came together so that i could provide you with this fun quiz!
